            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I’m Sanika Godase, someone who is always curious and loves exploring new ideas and creative paths. Whether it’s sketching, coding, or diving into a good book, I’m constantly finding ways to feed my imagination. I enjoy being outdoors, connecting with nature, and taking time to appreciate the little things in life.</p>
            <p>In my free time, you’ll probably find me sketching new designs, learning about the latest tech trends, or planning my next adventure. I’m passionate about blending creativity with technology, and I believe that every day brings a new opportunity to learn something exciting. This website is a little glimpse into my world—feel free to explore!</p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by, and I hope we connect soon!</p>
